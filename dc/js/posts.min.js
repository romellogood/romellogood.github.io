While people are surfing the web, watching tv, walking around outside, or       even playing games on their phones; ads are everywhere. As a result of this       constant interaction, people have become numb to advertisements and ignore       most of them. A promotion must be executed in a way that really captures a       person’s attention and this is why we need savvy communicators and facilitators.       <br><br>Without them, a company’s message will end up ignored like the majority       of messages out there. With a savvy communicator a message goes from being       average to outstanding and engages the customer. Communicators like these       can make or break a company and are responsible for making sure the       organization’s goals and aspirations are successfully understood by the       masses.<br><br>An example of this from Summer of last year, would be the       way organizations fighting the California drought began to successfully       get their mission understood. For years as a resident of the state I have       grown up knowing we were in a drought and have seen posters and flyers       advocating water conservation. But it wasn’t until this year that I really       began to take notice and understand the problem. The facilitators inside       these organizations expressed our need for water and made me see just how       big the problem was. They all made me believe in their statement and try       my best to reduce my own water consumption. This is just one example of       how great communicators can impact a company’s success.</p>       <hr>'},2:{number:2,date:"January 21st",title:"Protest in the Snow",body:'<hr>       <p class="text">Today was the 5th Anniversary of the Citizen&#39;s United       Decision.

These people are revealed to not be world class athletes but regular people, no more special       than me and you. Reebok is showing us people who are seeking to better themselves in all       aspects of life. The message is that through sore muscles, bloodied blisters and dripping       sweat we can all "be more human". The commercial concludes with Reebok&#39;s new logo,       a Delta the symbol for change, to drive home the point that people should strive to       better themselves.<br><br>The ad is beautiful and makes use of a rhythmic beat, a       motivational narrator, and various images of people training. But what about the       message overall? Reebok is trying to say that through devotion to sports and fitness       you will "be more human". But what about those who don&#39;t do those things? Are they       disregarded for this and thus feel alienated from your brand? I know that the ad is       aimed towards the physically active and getting them to use Reebok&#39;s equipment,       but what about the average joe who isn&#39;t physically active?

The main reason being that usually, my girlfriend       doesn&#39;t like me spoiling her and this is the perfect day where       I&#39;m allowed to without her objecting. So I did exactly that. Last       year I made Aubs a candle lit dinner in our dorms so this time around I       wanted to take her out to a fancy restaurant. I found a nice place on       OpenTable called Bistro Bistro, located in Dupont Circle, and made       reservations. Also, Valentine&#39;s was on a Saturday so I decided to       send her flowers to work on Friday since she wouldn&#39;t be expecting       it. She loved them. That Saturday night we went to dinner and it was       amazing. It was a four course meal but it was one of the best meals I       have ever eaten.<br><br>But the best part wasn&#39;t the dinner, it was       the snow. While we were eating snow started falling and by the time we       were done there was quite a bit outside. Of course this resulted in an       impromptu snow ball fight between me and Aubs as we ran to the metro       station. I know we probably looked like weirdos. After a short metro ride,       but long enough for Aubs to fall asleep on, we were back at my apartment.       But not for long because Aubs, my roommate Ben, and I decided to go out       again and look for a Gay Bar.<br><br>Our quest was unsuccessful and       resulted in probably the longest metro ride of my life, a well needed       bathroom break at a Subway, and the discovery of Kramerbooks. Kramerbooks       is a 24 hour book story with a bar called The Afterwords in the back. Its       the perfect solution for those avid reader who finish their book in the       middle of the night and are just dying to know what happens in the sequel.       Needless to say I loved it. I bought two books and was so happy I even       shed a tear or two.

Hopefully he passes my information on and I hear from them.       Other then that, the talk was great and I took away some amazing       insight.<br><br>Afterwards we went to the actual tour. Having to walk a       couple of blocks in the snow with just business shoes and a thin layer of       dress socks was horrible. My feet almost feel off and the lines we had to       wait in were very long. After 3 different ID check points and a metal       detector we were allowed into the White House. The tour is self-guided       and is only a couple of rooms but the White House looks amazing.       There&#39;s so much history in every room and I&#39;m sure I could spend       hours learning everything in-depth.</p>       <img src="img/16-1.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-2.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-3.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-4.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-5.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-6.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-7.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/16-8.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>       <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/16-9.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>       <img src="img/16-10.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-11.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/16-12.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <hr>'},17:{number:17,date:"February 21st",title:"DC Improv",body:'<hr>       <p class="text">Tonight Aubs and I ventured to an improv show at the DC       Improv Club. Getting there was a little bit of a struggle and resulted in       us waiting in the metro for close to half an hour because of delays. Once       we we’re off the train we had to splash our way through multiple       snow-puddles while defending ourselves from the rain. At times like these       are when I truly miss the California sunshine. But overall the show was       great. The group of three that preformed was good and I would go back to       see them again. I think in the future we’ll go back to that club again but       to see an actual stand-up show.</p>       <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/17-1.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>       <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/17-2.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>       <img src="img/17-3.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/17-4.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/17-5.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/17-6.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/17-7.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <hr>'},18:{number:18,date:"February 22nd",title:"Shear Madness",body:'<hr>       <p class="text">As a program we went to The John F. Kennedy Center for the       Performing Arts to see Shear Madness. Shear Madness is the comedy whodunit       show that lets the audience solve the crime. It has been running everyday       for the past 25 years, and after seeing it I can see why. My first       thoughts after hearing how long its been showing for, is that the jokes       were going to be outdated and corny but this was not the case. The writers       of the show used material that was in some cases two weeks old and overall       I was laughing the whole time. The most important part being that majority       of the show was improved. You could see the actors make things up on the       spot and almost break character at times that were really funny. Each actor       was amazing and played their part well. But overall the whole show has       been meticulously planned out. There was a section where we, the audience,       got to ask the characters questions about their alibi; and with each       response the character was prepared to defend themselves and even had the       necessary props to really sell it. After 25 years the writers and show&#39;s       producers have thought of everything. I would definitely recommend seeing       the show should you ever find yourself near The Kennedy Center.</p>       <img src="img/18-1.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-2.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-3.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-4.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-5.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-6.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-7.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-8.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-9.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-10.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-11.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-12.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/18-13.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <hr>'},19:{number:19,date:"February 27th",title:"Assignment: Photojournalism",body:'<hr>       <p class="text">Photojournalism is a form of journalism that uses images       in order to tell a story. It differs from regular journalism in that these       images tell a unbiased, raw truth to its viewers or readers. They can also       include text as a description of what&#39;s going on but usually the story       is told soley with images. Photojournalism&#39;s lack of words allows the       reader to better empathize with the subject.      <br><br>       The way that photojournalist go about capturing their content is also       different because they are sometimes asked to put their lives on the line.       Photojournalist are responsible for going out into war zones and capturing       stills of the battle. They are out there on the front liness in not just       wars but many other hostile and dangerous environments. In recent memory       photojournalist were in the middle of the ebola outbreaks taking photos       so that we, the general public, could experinece it too.       <br><br>       Photjournalist concentrate on not just displaying a story but doing so in       a manor that effectively communicates a message and emotion.</p>       <hr>'},20:{number:20,date:"February 28th",title:"Standing on Canals",body:'<hr>       <p class="text">Today I made my second visit to Georgetown. Aubs and I       went to Baked and Wired for cupcakes and coffee. It was a great day to       walk around because the weather wasn&#39;t too bad. Afterwards while       walking around Georgetown we found that the Canal was frozen over. Us       being typical Californians we had never seen a frozen body of water this       big so we tested the strength of it and decided to stand on it. Yes. We       stood on top of a canal. I never thought I&#39;d be able to say that. To       celebrate our conquering over the elements we went to El Centro, a Modern       Mexican restaurant we found. They only had a selective menu as they were       preparing for dinner but I enjoyed the food.       <br><br>       Later we returned home and I decided to take a nap before dinner. It was       a good nap until I woke up and heard the fire alarm going off. I jumped       out of bed, threw on clothes, grabbed all of my valuable items, and left       my room. I had to run down 8 flights of stairs to the Lobby, which was       being occupied by every other resident in the building. Upon further       investigating the situation, or eavesdropping on other people&#39;s       conversations, I found out that someone had overcooked popcorn and set       off all of the alarms. This has lead to me a grand realization that, in       general, people don&#39;t make smart decisions while cooking. I say this       because two weeks earlier a lady on my floor decided to take a nap while       cooking and almost burned down the whole apartment building. Nevertheless       I think my building should provide cooking lessons for its tenants.</p>       <img src="img/20-1.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/20-2.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/20-3.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/20-4.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/20-5.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/20-6.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>       <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/20-7.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>       <img src="img/20-8.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/20-9.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <hr>'}};
