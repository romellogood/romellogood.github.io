Even though Congress is under construction, it was amazing to       tour the building. There&#39;s so much history in this city.

While people are surfing the web, watching tv, walking around outside, or       even playing games on their phones; ads are everywhere. As a result of this       constant interaction, people have become numb to advertisements and ignore       most of them. A promotion must be executed in a way that really captures a       person’s attention and this is why we need savvy communicators and facilitators.       <br><br>Without them, a company’s message will end up ignored like the majority       of messages out there. With a savvy communicator a message goes from being       average to outstanding and engages the customer. Communicators like these       can make or break a company and are responsible for making sure the       organization’s goals and aspirations are successfully understood by the       masses.<br><br>An example of this from Summer of last year, would be the       way organizations fighting the California drought began to successfully       get their mission understood. For years as a resident of the state I have       grown up knowing we were in a drought and have seen posters and flyers       advocating water conservation. But it wasn’t until this year that I really       began to take notice and understand the problem. The facilitators inside       these organizations expressed our need for water and made me see just how       big the problem was. They all made me believe in their statement and try       my best to reduce my own water consumption. This is just one example of       how great communicators can impact a company’s success.</p>       <hr>'},2:{number:2,date:"January 21st",title:"Protest in the Snow",body:'<hr>       <p class="text">Today was the 5th Anniversary of the Citizen&#39;s United       Decision.

We were       given the chance to listen to a Holocaust surviver and hear his story.       Afterwards we went through all of the exhibits at our own pace and learned       even more. The whole experience was very humbling. Hearing and reading       about what these people went through is amazing.

In this commercial we see people pushing         themselves to their physical and emotional limit through pain, exhaustion, and injury.       These people are revealed to not be world class athletes but regular people, no more special       than me and you. Reebok is showing us people who are seeking to better themselves in all       aspects of life. The message is that through sore muscles, bloodied blisters and dripping       sweat we can all "be more human". The commercial concludes with Reebok&#39;s new logo,       a Delta the symbol for change, to drive home the point that people should strive to       better themselves.<br><br>The ad is beautiful and makes use of a rhythmic beat, a       motivational narrator, and various images of people training. But what about the       message overall? Reebok is trying to say that through devotion to sports and fitness       you will "be more human". But what about those who don&#39;t do those things? Are they       disregarded for this and thus feel alienated from your brand? I know that the ad is       aimed towards the physically active and getting them to use Reebok&#39;s equipment,       but what about the average joe who isn&#39;t physically active? While this ad may       have motivated me, an athlete, and makes me want to work out, at the same time       does this drive another person away and make them feel unwanted?</p>       <hr>'},10:{number:10,date:"February 4th",title:"Union Station & National Mall II",body:'<hr>       <p class="text">We started the day by attending the Heritage Foundation for       a presentation on ISIS in Social Media.
