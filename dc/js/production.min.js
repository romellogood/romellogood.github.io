While people are surfing the web, watching tv, walking around outside, or even playing games on their phones; ads are everywhere. As a result of this constant interaction, people have become numb to advertisements and ignore most of them. A promotion must be executed in a way that really captures a person’s attention and this is why we need savvy communicators and facilitators.<br><br>Without them, a company’s message will end up ignored like the majority of messages out there. With a savvy communicator a message goes from being average to outstanding and engages the customer. Communicators like these can make or break a company and are responsible for making sure the organization’s goals and aspirations are successfully understood by the masses.<br><br>An example of this from Summer of last year, would be the way organizations fighting the California drought began to successfully get their mission understood. For years as a resident of the state I have grown up knowing we were in a drought and have seen posters and flyers advocating water conservation. But it wasn’t until this year that I really began to take notice and understand the problem. The facilitators inside these organizations expressed our need for water and made me see just how big the problem was. They all made me believe in their statement and try my best to reduce my own water consumption. This is just one example of how great communicators can impact a company’s success.</p><hr>'},2:{number:2,date:"Wednesday, January 21st",title:"Protest in the Snow",body:'<hr><p class="text"></p>       <img src="img/2-1.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/2-2.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/2-3.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>      <div class="col-sm-6 no-pad"><img src="img/2-4.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>      <img src="img/2-5.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/2-6.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <img src="img/2-7.jpg" class="img-responsive">       <p class="text"></p><hr>'},3:{number:3,date:"Friday, January 23rd",title:"NGP VAN: First Week",body:'<hr><p class="text">This was my first week at my new internship and it was amazing.
