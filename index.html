        Hi, my name is Romello Goodman (<span class="color"> mello good </span>)
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am a creative technologist that primarily works with web technologies. I apply them to a number of different contexts in the hopes of exploring how code and creativity are linked. For labor, I am a senior software engineer at The New York Times working on the UX Foundations team.

      <h3>Urban Planning & Codebase Architecture. Or, how not to end up with
        a Wendy's in the middle of your codebase</h3>
      <p>When urban planners design cities their decisions are at the scale of decades and millennia. As city’s mature they have to adapt and re-architect to meet changing demographics and use cases. Using Architect Pierre L'Enfant’s design of The United States capital I examine how systems change overtime from their initial ideation. I cover how we as engineers can use urban planning concepts to adapt our codebases and not end up like Washington, DC where 200 years later a Wendy’s food restaurant is located in the middle of one of the city’s busiest traffic circles.

      <p>Applying the React principle of “UI is a function of state” to SVGs and Graphic Design. We talk about using systems of componentization and state management to create and manage SVGs. Viewers leave the session with a firm understanding of creative coding practices and a new viewpoint for building systems in JavaScript. (May 2021 React Summit)</p>
