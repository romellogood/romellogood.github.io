One of the most notable icons familiar to OHIO is the Block ‘O’. I decided to do a different take on the ‘O’ making it the focal point of the plate, but utilizing more of a Circus Type approach. I love Circus and Western type styles, and with Ohio being one of the original “western” settlements, it gave me an excuse to pursue that direction. One of the other concepts I was considering was an adaptation or abstraction of the state flag, which like the American flag is comprised of red and white stripes with white stars on a field of blue. So I integrated the stars and the red & white stripes into the design of the plate.

The white letters are meant to be as legible as possible off all that green.<br>03. CHASSIS:<br>License plate holes are standardized. I designed around the template, respecting it.<br>04. STICKERS:<br>One time I screwed up and put the stickers on my Oregon plate in the wrong spots. And then tried to peel them off and switch them back, and had to go back into the DMV with my tail between my legs and jump back in line. If my memory serves me correct, the lady took pity on me and gave me new stickers. So the thinking around the “arrow shape” versions is that you maybe it makes a little more sense what goes where? Plus, maybe the sticker could come on a little kiss-cut shape, so you can peel it off easier? My sausage fingers always fuck the edges on those Oregon month/year stickers.<br>05. TYPOGRAPHY:<br>Oregon has always had a “hippie” thing going on. You see it intertwined with the civic institutions, local sensitivities and the idea that you don’t need a big house or a big car to have a nice life. The place has always felt laid back and comfortable. There’s just something about the place that doesn’t take the edge of everything. Far out, man. Far out west!<br>06.

I redrew the state seal to be more graphic, and designed a flag registration sticker as a reference to the sailing culture."},SouthCarolina:{name:"South Carolina",imgSmall:"sc-s.jpg",imgLarge:"sc.jpg",artist:"Jay Fletcher",link:"https://dribbble.com/jfletcherdesign",info:"South Carolina, “the palmetto state.” We’ve got palmetto trees everywhere – in the woods, at the beach, on t-shirts, on keychains, on our state flag, on our existing license plate, and pretty much anywhere else you could possibly think to show state pride. It’s a symbol that’s been done to death here in SC, but one you rarely (if ever) see done well. So to that end, I figured there was no sense redesigning the wheel, but instead took this project as a challenge to take what we’ve already got and bring it up to speed."},SouthDakota:{name:"South Dakota",imgSmall:"sd-s.jpg",imgLarge:"sd.jpg",artist:"Anthony Lane",link:"",info:"In doing research, South Dakota’s plates have gotten increasingly complex over the years by use of gradients, changes in typography, color and the handling of the Mount Rushmore graphic. In order to restore some of the simplicity found in earlier plates, I opted to eliminate the script wordmark and draw reference from the fun and quirky letterforms found in the award-winning plate from 1974. In addition, opting to do away with the current photo-realistic graphic of Mount Rushmore in favor of a simplified vector drawn version—commonly seen in earlier South Dakota plates. The plate is further differentiated by referencing the maroon and white color palette from the 1936 plate. Lastly, the addition of the wheat stalk badge in the lower left corner as an agricultural nod to plains of South Dakota."},Tennessee:{name:"Tennessee",imgSmall:"tn-s.jpg",imgLarge:"tn.jpg",artist:"Simon Sok",link:"",info:"I would say Tennessee is a diverse state. There’s history, music, food, nature, agriculture, and sports, just to name a few. To try to encompass the entirety of what represents the state cohesively is quite challenging. After many revisions I decided to keep it simple and classic. The major element used in the design was taken from the state flag. The emblem in the center represents the three Grand Division of the state—East, Middle, and West Tennessee."},Texas:{name:"Texas",imgSmall:"tx-s.jpg",imgLarge:"tx.jpg",artist:"Aaron Eiland",link:"https://dribbble.com/aaron-eiland",info:"Simple, legible and to the point with a color nod to a well known Texas brand. This plate would look at home in Austin or El Paso. The plate also features an understated endorsement for Willie Nelson for President in 2016."},Utah:{name:"Utah",imgSmall:"ut-s.jpg",imgLarge:"ut.jpg",artist:"Andrew Colin Beck",link:"https://dribbble.com/andrewcolinbeck",info:"Utah: my home for 2/3rds of my life. I wanted to give a nod to Utah’s Mormon history without being too overt - so I choose the beehive (a common symbol of early Utah, used by the pioneers that remains on the state flag today) - Originally the Mormon Prophet Brigham Young wanted to call the state “Deseret” which means Honey Bee because he envisioned the mormons, and Utah dwellers as people who through their own industry, craft, and hardwork would raise a beautiful city out of the dust of the desert."},Vermont:{name:"Vermont",imgSmall:"vt-s.jpg",imgLarge:"vt.jpg",artist:"Casey Martin",link:"https://dribbble.com/casejam",info:"Every winter (and sometimes every summer) I’d head up to the great state of Vermont with my family to ski and enjoy nature as a child. It’s been years since those times, but the densely coated green mountain line that fills the state will be forever burned in the photo library of my brain. I’ve always thought the Vermont plate had a certain minimal charm to it, so when I chose to redesign it I never had intentions of a major overhaul. My refresh of the plate added more of the state’s lovely green color, stripped out some unnecessary details and added a mark nodding the beautiful green trees and branch that is represented in the state seal."},Virginia:{name:"Virginia",imgSmall:"va-s.jpg",imgLarge:"va.jpg",artist:"Zack Davenport",link:"",info:"As a native North Carolinian, I spent a lot of time driving through the NC and VA borders while vacationing with my family to Virginia Beach, Richmond, or farther north. What I remember most about those drives as a kid was passing “Virginia Welcomes You” sign that lets you know you’ve crossed over into Virginia on I-85. To me that sign always felt so hospitable and now when I make the long drive back home from NYC, the sign is a marker that I’ve entered back into my home in the South.<br><br>For this license plate, I wanted to visualize that feeling of southern hospitality so I paired a cardinal and dogwood pedals (The state bird and flower for both Virginia and North Carolina) with warm, welcoming colors. The colors themselves are loosely based on Virginia Tech’s school colors as Virginia is one of the few states without an official color palette. I used ITC Caslon Bold and Book Italic for the type as it referenced the original serif font found on the road sign as well as gives off a friendly tone.<br><br>View the sign <a target='_blank' href='http://bit.ly/1ElftMz'>HERE</a>"},Washington:{name:"Washington",imgSmall:"wa-s.jpg",imgLarge:"wa.jpg",artist:"Jeremy Beasley",link:"https://dribbble.com/jeremypbeasley",info:"I started my design process with the usual research into what license plates were and where they came from. I used to collect plates as a kid so this was a nice little stroll down memory lane.<br><br>Over the years, plates have gone quite far away from their original utilitarian form, into a new type of personal and local expression. I’ve got nothing against expression (or even specifically with plates) but this trend has certainly led to some of the most horrid graphic design I’ve ever seen.<br><br>So many of the original Washington plates I found were quite beautiful in their simplicity. No nonsense, no graphics even. Just the name of the state and the big number, nothing distracting from the two key pieces. Design was entirely informed by it’s clear purpose and the production capabilities of the plates themselves.<br><br>Personally, it felt arrogant to not to start with where we were and build on that. Of all current state plates, Washington’s was certainly not the worst.<br><br>Nationally, Washington is all too associated with rain, grunge, rain, rain, Kurt Cobain, rain and general sadness. The blue and red colors of our current plates seemed quite strange to me and I saw little connection to the quite vibrant State I’ve come to know over the past three years. <br><br>Washington is the “Evergreen State” and you don’t need Wikipedia to know this. I still remember my entry to Seattle on I-90 driving out here from Chicago. From the Snoqualmie Pass to the hanging gardens over Mercer Island, the State was unbelievable fertile and green. From the literal “green-ness” of the landscape to the “green” thinking of the people here to the figurative growth of Seattle and the surrounding area - the color green was the obvious choice as the dominate color.<br><br>The type was something I experimented a lot with. Initially leaning towards a more folky typeface, as past plates have featured, I went with a custom version of Interstate Mono. Interstate has an obvious connection to the road and it’s edges allowed for nicely rounded embossing. The rounded edges were common in older plates (purely due to printing limitations) and ended up being something that stood the test of time and weather a lot longer than anything super detailed I might imagine.<br><br>I wrapped it up with a completely personal and subjective edit: replacing the existing Mt. Rainier graphic with a much more subtle hint at the Cascades. The gradient silhouette was taken from the Eastern view of the horizon, visible to much of downtown Seattle. There’s something magical about every sunset over the Cascades seen by the majority of Washington’s population in the Seattle/Tacoma area. <br><br>All in all this exercise was a nice break from designing for a screen and I’m honored to have represented my new home state along so many other fine designers."},WestVirginia:{name:"West Virginia",imgSmall:"wv-s.jpg",imgLarge:"wv.jpg",artist:"Jordan Butcher",link:"https://dribbble.com/jordanbutcher",info:"I chose the typefaces based on both the unofficial state logo (the flying WV), and the number typefaces are meant to look sharp like a pickaxe to represent the coal industry in the state. The colors, navy blue and old gold are the official colors of the state and present on the flag. The rolling mountains in the background are the Appalachian mountains in the moonlight, something the state is known for. The current plates are white with blue numbers, but I feel the darker background with lighter numbers would be easier for the law enforcement to see from a distance."},Wisconsin:{name:"Wisconsin",imgSmall:"wi-s.jpg",imgLarge:"wi.jpg",artist:"Andy Luce",link:"https://dribbble.com/andyluce",info:"Wisconsin is a special part of our country. Rolling farms, cheese abound, brats, beer, the Packers and people that truly are the salt of the Earth.<br><br>With my plate, I’m nodding to the legacy of the state’s rich history - with type reminiscent of milk bottles, produce crates and farming equipment, with an appearance of the best sweet corn in the Midwest. The brick red is the color of barns, and the color of the University of Wisconsin."},Wyoming:{name:"Wyoming",imgSmall:"wy-s.jpg",imgLarge:"wy.jpg",artist:"Jessie Farris",link:"https://dribbble.com/byjessiekay",info:"When thinking about Wyoming a lot more comes to mind then the iconic bucking horse and rider. Growing up an hour from the Wyoming border, I have very fond memories of the state. I’ve always loved their state flag. The simple bison illustration on blue background with red and white borders is simple but strong. When redesigning the plate I wanted to make sure elements from flag were apart of the main design. Along with the flag, I would be remiss for leaving out Wyoming’s epic landscape. So I made sure to add a mountain illustration in the background to pay tribute to the Tetons and the rest of Wyoming’s incredible landscape. To me Wyoming is rugged, simple, and strong. I hope that this plate exudes those great qualities of Wyoming that I am so very fond of."}},stateNames=["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","NewHampshire","NewJersey","NewMexico","NewYork","NorthCarolina","NorthDakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","RhodeIsland","SouthCarolina","SouthDakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","WestVirginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming"];
